-- for downloading the code
git clone git@baltig.infn.it:dune/sand-fluka.git

--for going to the right work folder
cd sand-fluka/fluka2edepsim




--for reading an edepsim file------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

root -q /eos/user/l/ldinoto/Edepsim_file/ECALSTT_FHC_Horn1Y_r1_001_5e16.200102.edep.root loadEDepSim.C

with loadEDepSim.C the software generates each time the library for a typical EDepSim File (I give him the ECALSTT...root file so we are sure it is right and the library is well generated)

then readEDepSim.C macro is called by loadEDepSim  and a file (ECALSTT..... or Provadep.root accordingly to the variable flukafile=true or false in readEDepSim.C) is read.

By readEDepSim.C macro the Primaries, the Trajectories and the Segment object are read and some infos are printed out.
